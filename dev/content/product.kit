                  <p>We believe that our Back Saws are the finest made anywhere. They are based on a British saw made in 1830. Owning one is like having a piece of woodworking history in your shop.
    
                    Since dovetailing is a ripping operation, where the kerf is running with the grain, our Dovetail Saw has its teeth filed to a rip profile. Solid milled Brass back, finest quality Swedish Steel blade, Cherry handle and traditional Brass split nut saw bolts.
                    With 15 points per inch, this Saw strikes an ideal balance between surface finish and speed. Teeth are set at .003" per side for a .026" kerf — narrow to help you cut straight.
                    
                    15 ppi rip.
                    Length, including handle, is 15", with an overall height of 4¼" .
                    Useable blade dimensions are 10" long by 1-5/8" deep x .020" thick.

                  <p>Sharpening:
                    The steel in your saw's blade is the best that's available. It is very hard and will stay sharp but  eventually, you'll have to sharpen it. You can do this easily yourself with a little practice. 
                    
                    Take a couple of pieces of thin, straight scrap and clamp them in your vise on either side of the blade so that the top of the scrap is flush with the bottom of the gullets on the teeth. Take your file and take one swipe per tooth. Notice the small groove the file leaves in the wood. This is a good gauge to show you how deep you're filing. The teeth are so fine on your saw that no more than one pass per gullet should be necessary. If you use this method consistently, you shouldn't ever have to joint your saw. Of course, Dovetail and Tenon Saw teeth are sharpened to a rip profile, so you can file all the teeth from the same side.

                    Maintenance:
                    It is a good idea to keep a coat of oil or silicon spray on your saw's blade when not in use. This will minimize the chance of rust forming on the blade. The blade is high carbon steel with no rust-inhibiting alloys added. The handle on your saw is oiled and buffed with wax to produce a natural finish. Wipe with oil as desired to refresh.

                  <p>Sawing:
                    You will find that your saw is a joy to use. Unlike most saws on the market, every Lie-Nielsen saw has been precision set, filed, and test cut in hardwood before it leaves the shop.
                    
                    The first thing you'll need to know about your saw is how to hold it. This may seem obvious, but many people try to wrap all four fingers around the handle. The proper grip is to wrap the middle, ring, and little fingers around the handle with the forefinger pointing along the Brass back. You’ll discover that in doing so, you will have much better control over how your saw tracks, and it will also feel very comfortable and natural.
                    
                    Your saw is very sharp when it arrives. When starting a cut, hold the saw blade so it is flush with the top of the stock. It is not necessary to tilt your saw at an angle when cutting. Best performance is obtained by sawing slowly and evenly with very little downward pressure. Your saw will track right to the line. Be aware, however, that due to the slight set, your saw will be hard to correct if it starts to cut away from the line. If that happens, it’s because you didn’t line it up properly when you started.
                    If you had a poor sawing technique before, your new saw will force you to learn the proper sawing technique. Don’t worry once learned, it’ll be smooth cutting. If your saw seems to “grab” the wood and jump around in the kerf, you’re using too much downward pressure. Ease up a bit and take long slow strokes.</p>
